# t-SNE

t-SNE stands for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. It is a powerful
technique for embedding
data into 2D or 3D for visualization purposes. It was introduced by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton, winner of 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, in this <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf">paper</a>.
This app lets you experiment with t-SNE for different datasets that you can paste on the text area of the app.
